# Energy Community Web Platform 

## Overview
This project consists of porting an existing mobile application into a web application for energy communities. The platform allows households and companies to monitor energy production and consumption and to trade energy within the community.

Additionally, the system includes a forecasting module that predicts future energy consumption and production using collected data. These predictions support decision-making and improve energy distribution between households with surplus and households with deficit.
